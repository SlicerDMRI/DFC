DFC: Anatomically Informed Unsupervised Deep Learning for Fast and Effective White Matter Fiber Clustering. (In submission soon)

## Installation
The code has been tested with Python 3.7, Pytorch 1.7.1, CUDA 10.1 on Ubuntu 18.04.  
whitematteranalysis  
scikit-learn

## Usage
To train a model for fiber clustering with tractography data:
```
python train.py -indir <path of training data>
```

To evaluate the model with testing data:
```
python test.py -indir <path of testing data>
```
Effective fiber clustering was achieved with the proposed method. Below is a visualization of the obtained clusters.
